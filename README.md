## About ReMedia

In ReMedia we study multimedia cultural memory: what we remember about culture, how we remember it, and how technology and media shape that memory. We take a "problem-centered," case-study approach to research. The projects below contain data, scripts, and documentation from case studies created by research partners and student research assistants. Scroll down for data related to digital humanities pedagogy. 

This portfolio provides descriptions of data building, web scraping, and computational analysis projects in ReMedia and led by the PI, Dr. Emily Christina Murphy. Some projects featured here are in-progress, and others are cleaned, completed, or on-hiaitus. This public-facing repository does not include any sensitive of living subject data. In ReMedia our primary data repository is Microsoft Teams on secure UBCO servers. If you have questions about these projects or curious to see more, please get in touch with the PI at emily.murphy@ubc.ca.

### 3. üü¢ [Feminism, Modernism, and Ego-Network](https://github.com/ecbmurphy/FeminismModernismEgoNetwork)
**Description:** A summary of what this project is about and any challenges you faced.

This project was the topic of a SSHRC postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Victoria with the Linked Modernisms project, a Mellon-funded fellowship at the Harry Ransom Centre at the University of Texas at Austin, and a Hampton New Faculty Grant at the University of British Columbia. ‚ÄúModernism, Feminism, and the Ego-Network‚Äù applies linked open data technologies to the personal, professional, and artistic networks of early-twentieth century women writers and editors. It asks two research questions: (1) How can contemporary technologies and social networks change how we understand the nature of women‚Äôs artistic and cultural contributions? (2) How can the study of women‚Äôs personal and artistic networks change the way we develop technologies for literary and historical inquiry? 

Linked open data is a metadata standard that may be structured to ‚Äú[allow] metadata to be connected and enriched‚Ä¶and links made between related resources‚Äù (‚ÄúEuropeana Linked Open Data‚Äù), and underpins linked resources in the Semantic Web. Most linked data projects construct a whole network and measure the importance of individual notes in a network through measures like degree, closeness & betweenness centrality. In this project my goal was to experiment with modeling "ego-networks," or sets of relationships that are all connected through a single node -- in this case a person, modernist editor, author, activist, socialite, and muse, Nancy Cunard. 

At the Harry Ransom Centre, my archival research focused on the Cunard collection, recording all of the connections represented by her letters. You'll find that data in Letters.csv. Here is a visualization produced in Gephi:
