## üë©‚Äçüíª About ReMedia

In ReMedia we study multimedia cultural memory: what we remember about culture, how we remember it, and how technology and media shape that memory. We take a "problem-centered," case-study approach to research. The projects below contain data, scripts, and documentation from case studies created by research partners and student research assistants. Scroll down for data related to digital humanities pedagogy.
