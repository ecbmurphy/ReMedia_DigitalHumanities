# Additional Ruby/bundler ignore for when you run: bundle install

# Specific ignore for GitHub Pages
# GitHub Pages will always use its own deployed version of pages-gem 
# This means GitHub Pages will NOT use your Gemfile.lock and therefore it is
# counterproductive to check this file into the repository.

## üë©‚Äçüíª About ReMedia

In ReMedia we study multimedia cultural memory: what we remember about culture, how we remember it, and how technology and media shape that memory. We take a "problem-centered," case-study approach to research. The projects below contain data, scripts, and documentation from case studies created by research partners and student research assistants. Scroll down for data related to digital humanities pedagogy.
